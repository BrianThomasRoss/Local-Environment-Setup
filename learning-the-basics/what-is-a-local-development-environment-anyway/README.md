# What is a Local Development Environment, Anyway?

No we're not asking you to pack your bags and move to California. When we talk about a local development environment, we're talking about talking about moving off of Colab, and being able to do that on our own machines. A **development environment** is simply just the environment in which you develop your code, so far that environment has been **remote**, a Jupyter notebook that is being hosted on one of Google's servers.  
  
Obviously there is a great deal of convenience that comes with having everything you need pre-configured and ready to go in a Colab notebook, and it's still a great tool for easily sharing your code and visualizations with others. However for other reasons many of which you will begin to learn in the next unit, Google's kindness will only take you so far. There are numerous benefits to a local environment that you'll come to love. 

* **Dependability** - Sometimes even Google's servers can go down, sometimes your internet can be spotty. If you have all your dependencies and projects on your personal machine this is no longer an issue and you can continue to code and spin models even offline.
* **Performance** - For many of you your computer is much more powerful than what is allotted to us on Google's servers. Increased speed means less time waiting for code to execute and more time working on the next iteration.

There are so many more reason however why working locally can be much more rewarding, from the level of customization, to the wealth of tools available to improve your workflow. So lets take a look at the different pieces that come together to make a local environment.

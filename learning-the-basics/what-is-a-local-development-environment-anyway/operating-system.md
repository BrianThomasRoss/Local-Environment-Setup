# Operating System

## Enabling Us to Communicate with Our Machines

At some point each of us have probably taken a peak into our desktops or seen the inside of a computer at the very least. The computer is made up of various hardware components. Memory, CPU, SSDs they work together to make a powerful machine that has undoubtedly changed the face of the planet as well as the trajectory of humanity. Your operating system is the thing in between you and those very expensive pieces of sand and precious metals. A typical OS usually breaks down something like this:

### **Kernel**

The kernel is what gives the operating system control over the various bits and pieces that make up our computers. For Windows users that is NT, which has been around for a while. For those on Mac and Linux there are less noticeable differences as both can trace their roots back to the days of Unix and BSD.

### **User Interface**

This is what we are most familiar with interacting with. There are 2 distinct user interfaces at play. The Terminal User Interface \(TUI\) and the Graphical User Interface \(GUI\) This is what allows us to issue commands to do certain things whether from the command line or by click buttons.

### **Application Programming Interfaces**

These are programmatic at heart and define the various interactions between different applications and services that we use day to day, as well as how they interact with the operating system.

## Things to Consider

Historically the Python community, as well as the data science community have trended towards UNIX based systems. The reasons for this can be debated but UNIX users, and Python users as well, have long been advocates for free open source software. This tended to be somewhat at odds with other platforms business models during the 90's and into today. The result however has been a tremendous sharing of ideas and tools between the Python and UNIX communities. Python is installed by default on most UNIX systems, and we can see the influence Mac and Linux users have had on a wide swath of the design and implementation of the language.

Kernel is **100%** possible, as demonstrated by countless people, to use Windows throughout your time here,  and even beyond. There is significant value in learning the Microsoft stack as well, because there are countless companies who use their products as an integral part of their day to day operations. We would be kidding ourselves if we thought that Microsoft was going anywhere anytime soon.

However even Microsoft themselves has started to come to love Linux in the past few years, and this has resulted in the creation of some wonderful tools like WSL, the Windows Subsystem for Linux, which allows Windows users to have access to a Linux kernel inside their Windows OS.

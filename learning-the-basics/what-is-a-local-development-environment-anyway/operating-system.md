# Operating System

## Enabling Us to Communicate with Our Machines

At some point each of us have probably taken a peak into our desktops or seen the inside of a computer at the very least. The computer is made up of various hardware components. Memory, CPU, SSDs they work together to make a powerful machine that has undoubtedly changed the face of the planet as well as the trajectory of humanity. Your operating system is the thing in between you and those very expensive pieces of sand and precious metals. A typical OS usually breaks down something like this:

* **Kernel**

The kernel is what gives the operating system control over the various bits and pieces that make up our computers. For Windows users that is NT, which has been around for a while. For those on Mac and Linux there are less noticeable differences as both can trace their roots back to the days of Unix and BSD.

* **User Interface**

This is what we are most familiar with interacting with. There are 2 distinct user interfaces at play. The Terminal User Interface \(TUI\) and the Graphical User Interface \(GUI\) This is what allows us to issue commands to do certain things whether from the command line or by click buttons.

* **Application Programming Interfaces**

These are programmatic at heart and define the various interactions between different applications and services that we use day to day, and allow those to interact with the OS as well.

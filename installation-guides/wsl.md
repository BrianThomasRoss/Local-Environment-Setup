### WSL Specific Configurations

###  Jupyter

Firefox is recommended, you'll need to install a modern browser in Windows before continuing. Internet Explorer will not work well.

```text
jupyter notebook --generate-config
```

```text
nano ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
```

At the bottom of the file that is opened paste the following:

```text
```shell script
c.NotebookApp.allow_remote_access = True
c.NotebookApp.browser = "/mnt/c/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/firefox.exe"
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = True
c.NotebookApp.use_redirect_file = False
```

* Exit nano: `ctrl-x` and `y` then `ENTER` to save the file.

This instructs Jupyter to open the correct browser when it is launched.
